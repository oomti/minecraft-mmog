The backend will periodically need information of:

For clustering

-Player:
FROM all server
  name/id
  pos(x,y,z)
  server
  
 For harmonizing maps
 
 -Map_data:
   delta_chunk
   timestamp
   server
   
For sending player to other server:
   -player_data:
    name
    pos
    velocity
    inventory
    other_stats
    
   
 The backend will send data:
 
 -Player:
  conditional: if needs to be sent to a new cluster
    TO target server and previous server
    player_data:
      name
      pos
      velocity
      inventory
      other_stats
      
-Map_data:
  update global map
  update each server map for covered area
