simplified testing:

  player server transfer on specific condition (pos.x > CONST)
  
  exporting player data to log file from server
  
  making backend independent of minecraft code(nodejs or python)
  
  handling programmatic inputs on servers
  
There is an expectation of densely populated areas and sparsely populated areas.
Ideally servers should not change much in the area they cover, and so they would not need to reload a new segment of the map
Map in memory vs map stored on disk
Map data stored on a shared disk?
